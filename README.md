Call pricing
add to forward 
Brownian simulation of pricing, add swaps ( if it's related to bonds)
Monte carlo valatility simulation 
and once u r done send it to a structurer professional asking if it's a good model that u created, also you should know this is hedging modeling and not structuring ( part of structuring)
go for autocall products ( bonds based structured investement notes, in that case add swaaps, calls and puts) it's the most simple model, also the most requested by clients. 80% of structured notes are autocalls, don't waste time on digitals, exotic structured notes it's more complicated and it will take u more time and not worth it , go for the sinopliest models that can be done no more than 3-4 days 
DO not waste time on contacting traders they don't have time, contact mostly senior sales for example, and start with Indians if not contact indians in big banks in india for example
